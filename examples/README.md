# Examples

### How to Use:

Download the example folder and run the "run.sh" file in either terminal (Linux/Mac OS) or Git Bash (Windows).
The script will start up a local server on port 8080, which is necessary to serve the files.

After the server is started, go to http://localhost:8080. The editor can be used to demonstrate how to use the code and
experiment with different options. Keep in mind that workers persist between clicking "run"
